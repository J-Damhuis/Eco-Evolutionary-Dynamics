Made model with choice based on number of individuals present at resources and individual's feeding efficiency
Talked with Luis about different resource dynamics and discussed three different ways of implementing them
Had a talk and decided on using different model with choice based on summed feeding efficiencies of individuals present at resources
Made that model
Simulated with β ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 and s ranging from 0.0 to 10.0.
Found out speciation occurs even at high selection coefficients with random choice; also oscillations occur
Planned to change the model to use variable population size rather than a constant one (this has not been done yet)
Hypothesised that this could be because fitness gained is based on relative feeding efficiency, meaning that individuals with low feeding efficiency can still obtain high fitness if the other individuals have an even lower feeding efficiency
Proposed a way to fix this by changing the amount of the resource that could be found to depend on the sum of the feeding efficiencies of the individuals present at the resource
Ran a few more simulations with different parameter values:
	- β = 0.0, s = 10.0 and 300 feeding rounds: no different dynamics than at 10 feeding rounds
	- β = 0.0, s = 100.0 and 350 feeding rounds: speciation still occurs
	- β = 0.0, s = 1000.0 and 350 feeding rounds: no more speciation; hardly any variation within population; population mean still moves from fitness optimum
Talked with Rampal and he agreed with our way of changing the model. Main things to keep in mind:
	- Could be a numerical issue when taking the exponential of a large (negative) number -> can be checked by using step-based fitness landscape
	- Kmeans might not be good enough at defining two clusters when one of them is a lot smaller than the other -> he will see if he can find a different method someone used
	- System dynamics can be quite different when you use a different scaling factor for the amount of resource which is taken up
	- Think about how the model would scale if there were more than two resources (don't have to do much with this though)
Rampal sent a different method for defining when two clusters are present (taking the largest gap between two consecutive data points and dividing it by the mean gap between any data point), but it seems to be very inconsistent
Implemented the fix for fitness being based on relative feeding efficiency and it appears to be working as intended
Thought of another proxy for speciation: using the largest gap to split the population in two clusters and comparing the means of the two groups, but this seems to say more about the variance of the population than the likelihood of two clusters being present
Found yet another proxy for speciation: Gaussian Mixture Models. General case of kmeans, but this one can actually use different standard deviations per cluster. It also gives log-likelihoods
Figured out why the mean X-value of the population moves towards the middle before speciation actually occurs: the fitness advantage of individuals which are better adapted to resource 2 over the individuals which are worse adapted to resource 2 when feeding on resource 2 is greater than the other way around
